      <h2>harvesting toc's edits of the history page</h2>
      <p>Analysing the evolution of the structure of the Table of Content (TOC) throughout time dimension helped us to identify which issues were most important for the users involved in the page development.</p>

      <!-- Protocol 2 -->
      <h2>n-gram extraction and tf/tf-idf analysis</h2>
      <p>We processed the text corpus using some natural language processing techniques as fast part-of-speech tagger (identification of nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc. in a sentence) and n-grams extractor. For each extracted entity we calculated its Term Frequency (TF) and its term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), performed along the three categories of documents.
      We also excluded some overly generic entities and we used stop-word lists.</br>
      For this phase we used <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LRhKh4giB7t9DoWtpzRpFDVheuzymDSh_LR2SNb2YAk/edit">SVEN</a>, a software developed at DensityDesign | Politecnico di Milano and médialab | SciencesPo, that implement Pattern a text mining library developed at CLiPS | University of Antwerp.

      <!-- Protocol 3 -->
      <h2>visual relation n-grams/categories</h2>
      <p>The resulting n-grams have been visualized with a slopegraph model that allow to make several visual comparisons along the different categories of documents. All vertical lists in the diagram contain the same n-grams, thus highlighting the hierarchy of n-grams in the different categories and the specific number of occurrences associated to them, as well as the changing configuration when comparing TF and TFIDF n-grams.
