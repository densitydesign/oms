<!-- Protocol 3 -->
<h2>visual exploration of the aggregated results</h2>
<p>
  We aggregated the web pages at the domain name level in order to have a better and quicker overview of the corpus contents and by using a visual faceted search we explored which queries produced more valid contents, which domain name is more relevant (i.e. .org or .gov; .com or .co.uk).
