<h1>Analysing the temporal evolution of Wikipedia</h1>
<hr>
<p>The general analysis confirms WHO idea that “Family Planning” and “Birth Control” are the most relevant articles. While the total number of edits is very different for these two articles, analysing the temporal evolution of normalized data it is possible to identify some peaks. Both the articles, in different times, saw a first increase of edits, followed by a period with few edits. These peaks identify the creation of the first article core. It happened in 2006 for Birth Control and in 2008 for Family Planning. There are then some few peaks, and a major revision of the article in 2012 both for family planning and for Birth control.</p>
<p>On Wikipedia it is possible to define four main edits categories: minor, normal, vandalism and revert.<br>
<div class="row description">
<div class="col-md-3">
	<h4>minor edits</h4>
</div>
<div class="col-md-9">
	<p>are flagged by the editors and are small corrections like misspelling, typos, accents, dead URLs removal, or template updates.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-3">
	<h4>normal edits</h4>
</div>
<div class="col-md-9">
	<p>are meant to enrich the article.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-3">
	<h4>vandalism</h4>
</div>
<div class="col-md-9">
	<p>are edits against Wikipedia policies. They can be made in good faith (e.g. removing part of the article by accident) but more frequently they are intentional, meant to vandalize the article adding false facts, obscenities or partisan information trying to promote a particular view on the topic.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-3">
	<h4>revert edits</h4>
</div>
<div class="col-md-9">
	<p>are meant to restore a previous version of the article. Most of them are performed after a vandalism, to recover the article: the number of edits is indeed near to the vandalism one.<br>
	However sometimes users use reverts to disadvantages another point of view, acting as vandals. When this happens it is possible to see a series of reverts, these are called “edit wars”. In this case we count only the last edit as revert (the one bringing to article stability) and counting as vandalisms all the previous.
