<h1>Mapping anonymous edits</h1>
<hr>
<p>Edits performed by not registeres users are often referred to as "anonymous editing", but in reality their actions are less anonymous than that of many other registered users: Wikipedia, indeed, guarantees more privacy for registered users than for unregistered ones. IP (Internet Protocol) addresses allow us to trace the location of anonymous edits.
