<h1>The evolution of the articles</h1>
<hr>
<p>Wikipedia articles are divided into sections and subsections, which are summarized in the so-called Table of Content (TOC): this is an articleâ€™s directory in which content is arranged in the order in which sections and subsections appear on the internet article. As long as it is the first thing that the reader of the encyclopaedia approaches, its structure and clarity is very important for the first glance of the topic.
