      <h3>Reaching the consensus</h3>
      <p>How knowledge sediments? which topics, taken for granted today, were highly debated in the past?
        When we read a definition on an encyclopaedia, often we don’t think to its revisions process; the debates among editors to define an event, a discovery, an historical character. Neither we think to the social, political and cultural instances that influenced it. With traditional encyclopaedias we don’t have these information, and it is very difficult to retrace the path followed from an edition to another.
        Wikipedia, the biggest and most debated online encyclopaedia, from its origins in 2001 kept the revision process transparent. Each edit, even the smallest one, is archived keeping information on the editor, the timestamp and comments to it. All these information are publicly available: for any article it is possible to see each revision, and to follow its evolution.<br>
        This huge amount of data allows us to trace the evolution of each topic definition, from a temporal, social, and geographical point of view.
