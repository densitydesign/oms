				<p>A woman's ability to choose if and when to become pregnant has a direct impact on her health and well-being. Family planning allows spacing of pregnancies and can delay pregnancies in young women at increased risk of health problems and death from early childbearing, and can prevent pregnancies among older women who also face increased risks. Family planning enables women who wish to limit the size of their families to do so. Evidence suggests that women who have more than four children are at increased risk of maternal mortality.</p>
				
				<p>Promotion of family planning - and ensuring access to preferred contraceptive methods for women and couples - is essential to securing the well-being and autonomy of women, while supporting the health and development of communities.</p>
			
				<p>An estimated 222 million women in developing countries would like to delay or stop childbearing but are not using any method of contraception.</p>

        <ul class="list-intro">
            <li class="list-intro-item">limited choice of methods</li>
            <li class="list-intro-item">limited access to contraception, particularly among young people, poorer segments of populations, or unmarried people</li>
            <li class="list-intro-item">fear or experience of side-effects</li>
            <li class="list-intro-item">cultural or religious opposition</li>
            <li class="list-intro-item">poor quality of available services</li>
            <li class="list-intro-item">gender-based barriers</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Family planning can prevent closely spaced and ill-timed pregnancies and births, which contribute to some of the world's highest infant mortality rates. Infants of mothers who die as a result of giving birth also have a greater risk of death and poor health.</p>

        <p>Male and female condoms provide dual protection against unintended pregnancies and against STIs including HIV. In addition it reduces the risk of unintended pregnancies among women living with HIV, resulting in fewer infected babies and orphans.</p>

        <p>Pregnant adolescents are more likely to have preterm or low birth-weight babies. Babies born to adolescents have higher rates of neonatal mortality. Many adolescent girls who become pregnant have to leave school. This has long-term implications for them as individuals, their families and communities.</p>

        <p>The unmet need for contraception remains too high. This inequity is fueled by both a growing population, and a shortage of family planning services. In Africa, 53% of women of reproductive age have an unmet need for modern contraception. In Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean - regions with relatively high contraceptive prevalence - the levels of unmet need are 21% and 22%, respectively</p>

        <div class="col-md-5 quote">
            By reducing rates of unintended pregnancies, family planning also reduces the need for unsafe abortion.
        </div>

        <p>While comprehensive and scientific analyses of the debates surrounding family planning in the scientific literature have been quiet limited, we are exploring innovative aspects we are exploring the Cartography of controversies by analysing and trying to understand and visualize the current debates and locations of the controversies related to family planning.</p>

        <p>The main innovative aspects of the Cartography of controversies is to try to overcome some limitations of more traditional ways to observe and describe social relevant issues.</p>
