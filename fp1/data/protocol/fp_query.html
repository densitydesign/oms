<!-- Protocol 2 -->
<h2>cleaning and tagging the webpages</h2>
<p>We qualified and tagged all the webpages accordingly to their contents and excluding from the corpus pages not concerned with Family Planning (i.e. PDF, Videos, etc.). The resulting taxonomy is composed by three main groups of categories, with a special focus on controversial issues.
</p>

<!-- Protocol 3 -->
<h2>visual exploration of the aggregated results</h2>
<p>
We aggregated the web pages at the domain name level in order to have a better and quicker overview of the corpus contents and by using a visual faceted search we explored which queries produced more valid contents, which domain name is more relevant (i.e. .org or .gov; .com or .co.uk).
