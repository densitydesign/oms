<h1>Harvesting the Relevant Webpages</h1>
<hr>
<p>We designed 9 different queries to collect the most relevant web-pages addressing the Family Planning. The different queries have been designed to address as much as possible “nuances” of the Family Planning issues: from the more medical ones to the more daily ones.<br>
We qualified and tagged all the webpages accordingly to their contents obtaining three main webpages groups:</p>
<div class="row description">
<div class="col-md-3">
	<h4>medical</h4>
</div>
<div class="col-md-9">
	<p>relates to medical/public health information.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-3">
	<h4>contentious</h4>
</div>
<div class="col-md-9">
	<p>relates to sites that are more likely to show debate/controversy in the following areas:
		Risk & Benefit, Youth, Family Size, Law, Advocacy, Religion, Politics, Programme, Education, Development, Finances, Human Rights
	</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-3">
	<h4>natural family planning</h4>
</div>
<div class="col-md-9">
	<p>relates to site that present information on natural family planning, they are worthwhile exploring as they often highlights the risk of artificial methods and might have religious affiliations.</p>
