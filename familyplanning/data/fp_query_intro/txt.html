<h1>Harvesting the Relevant Webpages</h1>
<hr>
<p>We designed 9 different queries to collect the most relevant web-pages addressing the Family Planning. The different queries have been designed to address as much as possible “nuances” of the Family Planning issues: from the more medical ones to the more daily ones.<br>We qualified and tagged all the webpages accordingly to their contents obtaining three main webpages groups:</p>
<div class="row description">
<div class="col-md-3">
	<h4>medical information</h4>
</div>
<div class="col-md-9">
	<p>Description needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-3">
	<h4>contentious information</h4>
</div>
<div class="col-md-9">
	<p>Description needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-3">
	<h4>natural family planning</h4>
</div>
<div class="col-md-9">
	<p>Description needed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the following visualizations you can see which query, so which kind of issue formulation, produced more content, which web-site is related to more than one formulation, which domain name is more present and which webpages group is more represented in the corpus.</p>
