<hr>
<p>TBD research questions
We queried Google.com, Google.fr, Google.co.uk, Google.it for retrieving the first 1000 images liked to the Cesarean Section. After having cleaned the images not relevant we have categorized them into 17 different categories. 
The visualization allows to observe the quantity of images extracted for each language and each category providing with an overview of the different imaginaries.
