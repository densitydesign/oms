      <h3>introduction</h3>
      <p>Caesarean Section is a life-saving surgical procedure for both, mother and baby, used when certain complications arise during pregnancy or childbirth. As with other medical interventions and procedures, <span class="bold">its use follows the global pattern of health care inequity:</span> underuse in low-income settings and adequate or even overuse in middle- and high-income settings.</p>
      <p>Deliveries by Caesarean Section (as opposed to vaginal or “normal” delivery) are growing in an unprecedented and uncontrolled manner. In 1985 the World Health Organization (WHO) stated: <span class="italic">“There is no justification for any region to have Caesarean Section rates higher than 10–15%”<sup> 1</sup>.</span></p> 
      <p>Despite this recommendation, the proportion of babies delivered by Caesarean Section has been steadily increasing over the last decades, becoming a major public health concern and a cause of considerable multi-polarized debate and discussions. Recent figures show that most of the middle- and high-income countries exceed this recommendation and many present Caesarean Section rates over 30%. There is lack of scientific evidence indicating any substantial maternal and perinatal benefits from increasing rates, and some studies have shown that high Caesarean Section rates could be linked to negative consequences in maternal and child health.</p>

      <p>Determinants of the use of caesarean delivery are multiple and in many cases are context/country specific with little room for a “one-fits-all” answer. The use of Caesarean Section is higher in more favoured than less favoured social classes, although the opposite has been observed in some cases. Private maternity units have a higher rate than public maternity units. On the part of the doctors, other factors included the fear of litigation, convenience for health professionals, and reduction in the training of obstetricians in operative vaginal delivery. On the part of the women <span class="bold">caesarean delivery has become increasingly fashionable.</span> Factors contributing to this are: reduction of pain during delivery, ease of scheduling a convenient date and time for the birth, or belief that it reduces pelvic floor injury. There is certainly an increasing proportion of Caesarean Section on demand, requested by women without medical indication. In specific countries, a Caesarean Section may be used to perform a tubal ligation as a permanent method of contraception. Many activists see the dilemma between Caesarean Section and vaginal delivery beyond medical indication as the ‘race’ for humanization of birth where women are in control, with high tech delivery under obstetric control. Lastly, at all levels, misallocation of health resources without any identifiable benefits is also a cause for concern.

      <p>This rising trend builds over potentially numerous actors who could be playing a substantive role.</p>
      <div class="col-md-12 quote-large" style="text-align:center">
      How do women make the decision? Who is shaping women’s opinions?</br>What is the source of information that can play a critical role?</br>Which are the pressure groups driving the debate?
      </div>
      <p>All these are important questions whose answers will help to understand this trend. <br>We propose to explore, analyse, understand and visualize the current debate and controversies in the area of Caesarean Section using the methodology and techniques of <span class="bold">Cartography of Controversies.</span>
