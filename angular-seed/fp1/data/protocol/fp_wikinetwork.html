      <h2>HARVESTING THE MAIN ARTICLE LINKS</h2>
      <p>To analyse the relationship between the main page and the ones that stemmed from it, Using Wikimedia APIs we wrote a small sketch in processing that, starting from the page “Family Planning” crawls all the “Main article” links.

      <h2>(VISUAL) NETWORK ANALYSIS</h2>
      <p>The results are visualized with the software GEPHI, an open-source network analysis and visualization software package, with the use of its force-based algorithm, ForceAtlas2, we produced a networks of the articles connected to “Family planning”.

      <!-- Protocol 3 -->
      <h2>visual relation n-grams/categories</h2>
      <p>The resulting n-grams have been visualized with a slopegraph model that allow to make several visual comparisons along the different categories of documents. All vertical lists in the diagram contain the same n-grams, thus highlighting the hierarchy of n-grams in the different categories and the specific number of occurrences associated to them, as well as the changing configuration when comparing TF and TFIDF n-grams.
