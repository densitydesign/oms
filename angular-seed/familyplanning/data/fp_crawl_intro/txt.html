<h1>Crawling and mapping the connections in the corpus</h1>
<hr>
<p>We followed the web-pages hyperlinks to discover other relevant URLs. After having aggregated the web pages at the domain name we created a network and its associated graph. Here the web sites are linked together if there is an hyperlink connecting their webpages. </p>
<p>The graph has been drawn using a force-vector algorithm. These algorithms works by arranging the nodes simulating a physical system where nodes repulse each other while arcs bounds them like springs. 
</p>
<p>In this kind of graph the distance is a signiﬁcant parameter to interpret the graph and it is possible to proceed to a quanti-qualitative analysis to discover two kind of clusters and nodes
