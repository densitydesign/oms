<h1>Analysing the temporal evolution of Wikipedia</h1>
<hr>
<p>Focusing on the temporal evolution of the “Family planning” and “Birth control” articles we can see that, while the total number of edits is very different for these two articles, by normalizing the data it is possible to identify some common peaks. Both the articles, in different times, saw a first increase of edits, followed by a period with few edits.
Both pages have a first peak of edits: it is the first article core creation. It happened in 2006 for Birth Control and in 2008 for Family Planning. 
Articles grew slightly during time. But a certain point the amount of information added by different authors needs to be uniformed. In 2012 it is possible to see a major revision of both articles, involving several users.</p>
<p>On Wikipedia it is possible to define four main edits categories: minor, normal, vandalism and revert.<br>
<b>Minor</b> edits are flagged by the editors and are small corrections like misspelling, typos, accents, dead URLs removal, or template updates.<br>
<b>Normal</b> edits are meant to enrich the article.<br>
<b>Vandalism</b> are edits against Wikipedia policies. They can be made in good faith (e.g. removing part of the article by accident) but more frequently they are intentional, meant to vandalize the article adding false facts, obscenities or partisan information trying to promote a particular view on the topic. <br>
<b>Revert</b> edits are meant to restore a previous version of the article. Most of them are performed after a vandalism, to recover the article: the number of edits is indeed near to the vandalism one.<br>
However sometimes users use reverts to disadvantages another point of view, acting as vandals. When this happens it is possible to see a series of reverts, these are called “edit wars”. In this case we count only the last edit as revert (the one bringing to article stability) and counting as vandalisms all the previous.</p>
