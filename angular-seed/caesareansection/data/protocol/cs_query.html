<!-- Protocol 1 -->
<h2>harvesting the web corpus</h2>
<p>We collected the first 100 Google.com results (in incognito mode) harvesting their URL for each of the following queries:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"C-Section"</li>
  <li>"CS delivery"</li>
  <li>"Surgical delivery"</li>
  <li>"Abdominal delivery"</li>
  <li>"Cesarean delivery"</li>
  <li>"Caesarean delivery" </li>
  <li>"Operative delivery"</li>
  <li>Caesarean Cesarean</li>
</ul>
<p>The different queries have been designed to address as much as possible "nuances" of the CS concept: from the more technical and medical ones ("Caesarean delivery", "Operative delivery") to the more ordinary ones ("C-Section", "CS delivery".</p>

<!-- Protocol 2 -->
<h2>cleaning and tagging the webpages</h2>
<p>We qualified and tagged all the webpages accordingly to their contents and excluding from the corpus pages not concerned with CS (i.e. PDF, Videos but also cesarean section on animals). In this way we obtained three main webpages groups:
  <ul>
    <li>Medical Information; </li>
    <li>Contentious Information;</li>
    <li>Experiential Information.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<hr>

<!-- Protocol 3 -->
<h2>visual exploration of the aggregated results</h2>
<p>
  We aggregated the web pages at the domain name level in order to have a better and quicker overview of the corpus contents and by using a visual faceted search we explored which queries produced more valid contents, which domain name is more relevant (i.e. .org or .gov; .com or .co.uk).
