     <!-- Protocol 1 -->
      <h2>scraping the text corpus</h2>
      <p>We scraped the text of each webpage contained in the web corpus built in the previous phase. The resulting documents kept the categorization of the original web pages and was therefore organized into three groups:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a) Medical Information;</li>
        <li>b) Contentious Information;</li>
        <li>c) Experiential Information.delivery"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In order to have as much clean content as possible we applied BOILERPIPE, an algorithm used to detect and remove the surplus "clutter" (boilerplate, templates) around the main textual content of a web page.</p>

      <!-- Protocol 2 -->
      <h2>n-gram extraction and tf/tf-idf analysis</h2>
      <p>We processed the text corpus using some natural language processing techniques as fast part-of-speech tagger (identification of nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc. in a sentence) and n-grams extractor. For each extracted entity we calculated its Term Frequency (TF) and its term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), performed along the three categories of documents.
      We also excluded some overly generic entities and we used stop-word lists.</br>
      For this phase we used <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LRhKh4giB7t9DoWtpzRpFDVheuzymDSh_LR2SNb2YAk/edit">SVEN</a>, a software developed at DensityDesign | Politecnico di Milano and médialab | SciencesPo, that implement Pattern a text mining library developed at CLiPS | University of Antwerp.

      <!-- Protocol 3 -->
      <h2>visual relation n-grams/categories</h2>
      <p>The resulting n-grams have been visualized with a slopegraph model that allow to make several visual comparisons along the different categories of documents. All vertical lists in the diagram contain the same n-grams, thus highlighting the hierarchy of n-grams in the different categories and the specific number of occurrences associated to them, as well as the changing configuration when comparing TF and TFIDF n-grams.
