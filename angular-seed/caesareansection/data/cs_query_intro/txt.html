<h1>Harvesting the Relevant Webpages</h1>
<hr>
<p>We designed 9 different queries to collect the most relevant web-pages addressing the Cesarean Section. The different queries have been designed to address as much as possible “nuances” of the Cesarean Section issues: from the more medical ones to the more daily ones.<br>We qualified and tagged all the webpages accordingly to their contents obtaining three main webpages groups:</p>
<div class="row description">
<div class="col-md-3">
	<h4>medical information</h4>
</div>
<div class="col-md-9">
	<p>These pages contain medical explanations and theories proposed with neutral tone. Often, they are stating medical or historical facts or physiotherapy and recovery-related issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-3">
	<h4>contentious information</h4>
</div>
<div class="col-md-9">
	<p>These pages are fostering the real debate and are dealing with issues related to the adoption rates, humanization of birth and humanization of caesarean section.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-3">
	<h4>experiential information</h4>
</div>
<div class="col-md-9">
	<p>These pages contents related to experience from women, fathers as well experience or opinions from VIPs and celebrities.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the following visualizations you can see which query, so which kind of issue formulation, produced more content, which web-site is related to more than one formulation, which domain name is more present and which webpages group is more represented in the corpus.</p>

NOTE<br>
If medical facts refer to a controversy or if they are stated within a context of controversy or pointing to a controversy, they were classified as medical and contentious.<br>
In medical articles that present evidence that is conflicting based on whatever parameter (quality of evidence, conflicting results or lack of studies) we will tag as medical and contentious.<br>
For pages in which women (women’s experiences) discuss controversial issues, these were classified as both experiential and contentious.<br>
In controversies that refer to the past (for example in historical articles), these will be tagged as medical and not contentious because we are only interested in current issues.<br>
